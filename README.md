# content-creator-mobile-app

A Flutter application that helps content creators organize folders, gather sources (YouTube channels, websites, newsletters), and generate instant idea summaries per folder. 

## What’s included
- Folder dashboard that lists every collection with AI-style insights (idea count, quick summary, number of sources).
- Detail view for each folder with the ability to add sources and refresh summaries on demand.
- Sample data so you can explore the experience immediately after running the app.

## Getting started
1. Install Flutter (3.22+) and run `flutter pub get`.
2. Launch the app with `flutter run` on Android, iOS, or web.
3. Create folders, attach content sources, and let the smart summary section highlight how many ideas are ready to produce.
